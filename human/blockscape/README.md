# Blockscape

[![Ask DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/badge.svg)](https://deepwiki.com/pwright/blockscape)

A simple, interactive web application for creating and visualizing landscape-style tiles that represent value chains, system architectures, or any hierarchical dependency relationships.


## Quick Start

1. Install deps: `npm install`
2. Run the Svelte app: `npm run dev` then open http://localhost:5173
3. Use the [prompt](map-generation-prompt.md) to generate json for your domain.
4. Click tiles to see dependency relationships
5. Click `Edit` to manually change the currently selected tile (or whole map).

To ship a static bundle: `npm run build` then serve the generated `docs/` folder (`npm run preview` for a local check).
The build also renders the MkDocs site; install Python + MkDocs once via `pip install -r documentation/requirements.txt`.
Legacy `index.html` remains checked in for reference; the Svelte build is now the primary entry.

On startup the app auto-loads `blockscape.bs` and `planets.bs` from the public assets so you have data to explore immediately.

## Blockscape: mapping the architectural lifecycle, not just the system

Architectural diagrams capture *structure*.  
Wardley Maps capture *evolution*.  
**Blockscape** can unify both — by making architecture **narrative, dynamic, and co-evolving** with design intent.

Instead of being another “draw a diagram” tool, *Blockscape* becomes the **canvas for strategic system literacy** — where AI-generated structure meets human contextual intelligence.

## 🔁 A lifecycle built for hybrid reasoning

Let’s illustrate your proposed lifecycle using ASCII metaphors:

---

### **1\. LLM blockscape generation — rapid topology seeding**

LLM reads docs / repo / infra manifests → generates base map

Use [GPT](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-690f6217889c819191786ef16481f534-blockscape)
or [prompt](map-generation-prompt.md) to generate json for your domain.


🧠 **Value:**  
The LLM can quickly create a **Wardley-like skeleton**: all visible components, dependencies, and rough placement along the evolution axis.  
It replaces hours of manual “whiteboard archaeology.”


### **2\. Manual editing — human sense-making**

Engineers adjust positions, rename blocks, add missing context:

🛠 **Value:**  
Humans know subtleties: “This service is innovative” or “This dependency is a liability.”  
They embed lived knowledge — things not yet in code or docs.

### **3\. LLM refinement — structural intelligence**

The LLM reanalyzes edits to:

- Normalize naming
- Suggest missing dependencies
- Recommend repositioning based on patterns
- Optionally generate narrative summaries (“your differentiator is shifting from data pipelines to analytics”)

🧩 **Value:**  
This creates **symmetry between architecture and strategy** — the LLM reasons from patterns, humans correct nuance.

### **4\. Manual editing — strategic judgment**

The human layer again asserts intention:

- “We *choose* to keep item on left because we're working on developing that item.”
- “We’ll outsource this commodity, shift the item to the right”
- “Let’s flag this as risk.”

This is the **decision recording step**, not the design correction step.


🧭 **Value:**  
Maps become living documents — not static outputs, but design conversations.

---

### **5\. LLM add ‘external’ links — ecosystem integration**

Finally, the LLM can add links to `external` references:

- GitHub repos
- ADRs
- RFCs
- Docs and diagrams
- Product roadmaps
- Vendor APIs

🔗 **Value:**  
The map stops being a picture — it becomes an *index of reality*.  
Every node connects outward, making the system traceable and auditable.

## 🚀 Why this lifecycle matters

| Phase | AI Strength | Human Strength | Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Generation | Speed, recall | Context | Draft from chaos |
| Manual edit | Insight | Strategy | Intent embedded |
| Refinement | Consistency | Validation | Smarter structure |
| Manual judgment | Tradeoffs | Accountability | Actionable decision |
| External linking | Search & correlate | Curate relevance | Knowledge graph |

Together, this yields a **living, evolving architectural landscape** — a *blockscape* — where maps can be regenerated and reinterpreted as systems evolve.

---

## 🧩 Why this is strategically powerful

1. **Closes the loop** between *architecture-as-built* and *architecture-as-strategic*.
2. **Bridges AI and human expertise** — neither replaces the other.
3. **Creates artifacts that age gracefully** — maps remain relevant as the system evolves.
4. **Positions Blockscape as the “Wardley Maps for Systems”** — but with LLM-assisted lifecycle management.


## ✨ In short

> **Blockscape** turns architecture into a conversation between humans and machines —  
> starting with AI’s speed, grounded by human judgment, and expanded by linked knowledge.

The skeptic who values architecture diagrams gains something extra:

- Not *another* diagramming tool, but
- A *thinking tool* that explains **why** their architecture should evolve in certain directions — and helps the system documentation keep pace.


## Visual Indicators

- **Blue border**: Dependencies (items this component enables)
- **Red border**: Dependents (items that depend on this component)
- **Orange badge**: Reused components (used by multiple other components)
- **Dashed border + ↗ icon**: External reference link available

## Display Settings

- **Hide parentheses in names (default ON):** Item tiles and search results drop any trailing “( … )” from names so labels stay concise. Toggle it in **Settings → Hide parentheses in names**; it persists locally and never alters the underlying JSON.

## Built-in Templates

The application includes two example templates:

1. **Blockscape**: A generic value chain template showing communication effects, inputs, modeling, rendering, and outputs
2. **NFR**: Explore non functional requirements
3. **Deployments**

## Usage

### Creating a New Model

1. Click "Add JSON files" to load from files, or
2. Use the JSON editor at the top to paste your model
3. Click "Append model(s)" to add to existing models
4. Use the model selector to switch between models

### Editing Models

1. Select a model 
2. Click **Edit**
3. When you're finished editing, click **View**

NOTE: This process creates new tabs in your browser.

## Navigation and moving blocks

- **Select tiles** with the mouse or use bare `←/→` to walk through tiles horizontally; `↑/↓` jump between categories while keeping the nearest column alignment.
- **Keyboard moves**: `Shift+←/→` reorder the selected tile within its current category and `Shift+↑/↓` move it to the previous/next category, inserting it near the same column.
- **Drag and drop** any tile onto another category to reorder or recategorize; the JSON backing data updates immediately so downloads/exports pick up the new layout.

- **Del** to delete an item (ctrl-z to undo)

### Loading a remote .bs file via URL

Append `?load=<url>` (or `#load=<url>`) to the app URL to auto-load a remote `.bs`/JSON file. Examples:

- `https://blockscape.app/?load=https://example.com/my-map.bs`
- `https://blockscape.app/#load=https://gist.github.com/user/gistid#file-map.bs`

Gist page URLs are rewritten to their raw content automatically; direct `gist.githubusercontent.com/.../raw/...` links also work.

## Development

- Primary app lives in `svelte/` (Vite + Svelte). Run `npm run dev` for the dev server on http://localhost:5173.
- Production bundle: `npm run build` (writes `docs/`). `npm run preview` uses Vite’s preview server; `npm run serve` serves the built assets via `http-server`.
- Optional local backend for loading/saving `~/blockscape/*.bs`: `npm run server` (after `npm run build`). Default URL with backend enabled: http://127.0.0.1:4173/server. Root can be changed via `BLOCKSCAPE_ROOT=~/somewhere npm run server`. Without the backend, the app runs in static mode (no local file API).
- You can deep-link to a specific local model by appending its relative path: `http://127.0.0.1:4173/server/path/to/file.bs` will auto-load and auto-reload `~/blockscape/path/to/file.bs` on refresh. Append `/model-id/item-id` to jump straight to a particular model/item in that file (IDs are taken from the model JSON).
- Static legacy `index.html` remains for reference only; all active work should target the Svelte app.
- Watch/validate models and extract from markdown: `node scripts/watch-models.js --dir <path> --out-dir <path>` (use `--once` for a single scan).

### Adding New Logos

1. Add SVG files to the `logos/` directory
2. Reference them in your JSON model using the path `"logos/filename.svg"`

### End-to-end Tests

Two Cypress specs exercise both entry points:

- `cypress/e2e/model-preview.cy.js` (landing page preview workflow)
- `cypress/e2e/editor-workflow.cy.js` (JSON editor CRUD + reorder workflow)

Steps:

1. Install dependencies with `npm install`
2. In the first terminal, start the static server and leave it running: `npm run serve`
3. In another terminal (and after unsetting Electron overrides with `unset ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE ELECTRON_NO_ATTACH_CONSOLE` if they are present), run:
   - Headless: `npm run cypress:run`
   - Interactive: `npm run cypress:open`
   - JSON report + artefacts: `npm run cypress:report` (writes `cypress/results/report.json`, videos, and failure screenshots)

See `cypress.md` for troubleshooting notes and more detail on the captured artefacts.
